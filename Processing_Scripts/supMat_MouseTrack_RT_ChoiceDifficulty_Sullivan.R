# This script was written by Alaina Pearce in 2019 for the
# purpose of processing the DMK SC_mouse tracking food choice
# task. Specifically, this script extracts reaction time for
# food choice based on choice difficulty as defined by Sullivan
# et al., (2015) - supplemental materials for Pearce et al., 2020
